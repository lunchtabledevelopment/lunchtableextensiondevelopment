<h1>Lunchtable Third-Party Extension Development tools </h1>
<h2>(beta)</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The lunchtable Third Party is a development Package allowing the community and Third Party Companies to develop  extension packages for the lunchtable web application. **This project does not mean that Lunchtable is an Open Source Application,**  and for that reason the development tools will include **a run down licenced development version of lunchtable**, That still includes all the necessary tools with the real web application. This also means that we will only be supporting developer access to part of the webapp. You can upload your extension to the Lunchtable Extension Marketplace In an Upcoming version, Though this does mean that lunchtable has the right to remove or terminate your extension if it does not suit our needs for our extension program and we may not support it working with our site as well. Though back to the good things

<h2>How we designed Lunchtable</h2>
Lunchtable was developed in mostly Javascript with of course the addition of CSS and HTML for UI and development with the Google Firebase.api. Lunchtable has one important tool that we used for development of the main app, a DevTools Option for testing things. If you change the Variable DevTools to the False Boolean it will not use the devtool mod. 


<h2>Important:</h2>
Though you may be able to view and download the code from our webapp that does not mean it is licenseable, You may face legal action for using code that is privately owned and unavailable for other use and is also braking our Terms of service, Your extension may be terminated if these guidelines are not followed. Thank you!



<h2>What Do we Mean “Not Open Source” </h2>
Well as a company Lunchtable has not decided to make our project open source for our own reasons. So the things you may be able to do with extensions may be limited to what we make available, But were looking to add more things later and in the future for the lunchtable project.

<h2>Verified Extensions</h2>
**Verified Extensions** are extensions that have been evaluated and tested by Lunchtable developers to be determined safe to use if your worried about extensions stealing information, we look through things like security flaws to bugs to make sure it won’t affect the user experience. To apply to make your extensions verified

<h2>Risky and Warned Extensions</h2>
At lunchtable we take the experience of our users very seriously, So if we evaluate an extension as Risky and Buggy we make claim it ask a ‘Risky’ Extension. This means that whenever people look at your extension they may get warned that this may bring a security flaw to there experience. If issues are not resolved or reported in progress 30 days after a warning is issued you're extension may be ‘pulled’ and users will not be able to download the extension until deemed safe again.


<h2>A few key goals to verifying and having an great extension!</h2>
 Try to keep your code simple! We value making your code simple. It makes it easier to work with our software as we try to keep things as simple as possible when it comes to our UI to our Back-end Engineering. This means using arrays and tools like that whenever possible
 We love a good UI!  At lunchtable one of our post important goals was to make a simple and modern UI. So we ask you to try and keep it that way, This leads to a better app at the end. Try looking at some of the examples that we include in the ‘GoodUI’ folder.
 Third Party Servers are a No-No! With our beta of our development program we are going to keep things basic by not allowing third-party servers. These could be risky for the user and the developer. We provide you with 10 dataStorage variables to allow you to keep things rolling. These rules apply differently if you are a verified developer.  Verified Developers will be able to use third-party servers with close monitoring.
 We want to help! If you're ever having issues with developing you’re extension, always feel free to contact us at our support website at support.lunchtable.com/extentions or support.lunchtable.com.  And a developer here at lunchtable can maybe help you out!
 Verification is not hard!  Here at lunchtable verification is all about making sure the extension is secure and safe for the user. Applying isn’t too hard! Just apply at extensions.lunchtable.com/developer/verify to apply for verification. Your application must show full functionally with only mid to minor issues. Are developers may ask some quick questions about your project, But that's it.
